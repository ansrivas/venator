The Venator application is for recording, viewing, and filtering logs and spans from Rust programs instrumented with the tracing crate.

This is currently in an "alpha" state; bugs, quirks, and missing functionality are to be expected. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome.

Installation:

```
cargo install venator-app
```
