The Venator "engine" provides the functionality that powers the Venator app. It
is able to store, index, and query the spans, events, and related entities. Do
note that this crate does not have support for listening for events and spans.

Although the Venator application and tracing library are considered stable, this
crate isn't. It is still built and somewhat documented so that someone could use
it on its own.
